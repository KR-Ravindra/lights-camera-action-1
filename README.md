### Known Problems: 
No problems, works with all features as asked.

### Comments: 
Maybe I could implement techniques more in statically typed languages but in this i am half time second guessing logic vs syntax all that loop.

### To run:
You need to specify the object file to load at all times like below:

`./assignment_0 < torus.obj`
